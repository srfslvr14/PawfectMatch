Pawfect Match is a dating-app inspired way for potential dog adopters to easily and creatively find dogs that need adopting!

### **What problem is Pawfect Match Solving?**

A lot of people are turned off by the inability to find dogs to adopt that match their preferences, sucha s breed, house training, or kid safe, and simply rely on popular or weekly shelters such as Petsmart to hopefully find the perfect dog for their home. There can never be enough accessibility to adopting dogs from crowded shelters or previous owners and giving them a loving home.

### **How is Pawfect Match solving this problem?** 
Pawfect Match helps to solve this problem by allowing users to set preferences on certain dog breeds, gender, age, and other aspects, as well as search by location. By allowing all of these preferences to be woven into the searching aspect of adopting a dog, the process becomes even more straightforward and malleable. When matched with a dog, Pawfect match users can even directly contact the dogâ€™s shelter via email, phone number, or location to provide for even faster contact and potential adoption. Pawfect Match is simply another creative effort in making sure every dog can find their forever home, as well as helping adopters find them faster and easier.
